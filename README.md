Weave Loader is a tool designed to simplify the process of modding Minecraft, and specifically Lunar Client. It allows
developers to easily create mods by providing a simple and intuitive API for interacting with Minecraft's codebase,
while injecting into clients that are somewhat closed-off to developers.

### Installation

To install Weave-Loader, you can either download a pre-built release from
the [releases page](https://github.com/Weave-MC/Weave-Loader/releases), or build it yourself from source.

#### Building with Gradle

- `git clone` the project, this can be achieved by installing [git][git], then running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Weave-MC/Weave-Loader.git
```

- **UN*X**

```bash
cd Weave-Loader && chmod +x ./gradlew && ./gradlew agent
```

- **Windows**

```cmd
cd Weave-Loader && .\gradlew.bat agent
```

## Usage

To use Weave-Loader you have to take the agent from the last step and launch Lunar with `-javaagent:$PATH_TO_AGENT` appended to the JVM arguments.
Weave will automatically load mods from `~/.lunarclient/mods/`.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from anyone interested in improving Weave-Loader. If you find a bug or have an idea for a new
feature, feel free to submit a pull request.
